💡 What This Repository Offers

This repository is a **comprehensive showcase** of my hands-on experience in SQL — built with the mindset of learning by solving. It focuses on real-world data challenges that reflect the work of data analysts and business intelligence professionals.

I’ve structured this repository to:

* Demonstrate **mastery of SQL fundamentals** and intermediate-to-advanced querying techniques
* Apply SQL to **real datasets** with practical, goal-driven analysis
* Follow **clean and professional coding practices**
* Document **insights and decision-making logic**

Whether you are a recruiter, fellow learner, or hiring manager — this repository reflects my journey of becoming a skilled, job-ready data analyst.

📘 Core Focus Areas

✅ Query Writing

From basic `SELECT` statements to complex nested queries — showcasing versatility in retrieving meaningful insights from raw data.

✅ Data Cleaning

Using SQL to handle missing values, filter out inconsistencies, and format data for analysis.

✅ Aggregation & Grouping

Using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and aggregation functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) to summarize large datasets into useful business KPIs.

✅ Joins & Relationships

Merging multiple tables using `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` to derive relational insights.

✅ Window Functions

Applying advanced SQL concepts like `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()` to perform dynamic and ranked analysis.

✅ Subqueries & CTEs

Breaking down complex logic using `WITH` clauses and nested subqueries to improve readability and structure.

✅ Date-Time Functions

Working with timestamps, extracting parts of dates, and creating time-based trends and cohort analyses.

🧠 What I’m Practicing

* **Thinking like an Analyst**: Always framing questions like *“What is this data telling me?”* or *“What decision can this insight support?”*
* **Scalability**: Writing queries that can handle growing datasets
* **Optimization**: Learning to improve query performance and reduce execution time
* **Reproducibility**: Organizing projects so anyone can run and understand them



🎯 My Learning Goals

This repository is a stepping stone toward:

* 🔎 Becoming fluent in SQL for data analytics, product analytics, and business reporting
* 📊 Creating end-to-end dashboards in Power BI / Tableau using SQL-backed data
* 🧪 Tackling real company use-cases, interview questions, and capstone projects
* 🧩 Collaborating with others in open-source data projects




## 🧭 Final Note

> "I don’t just write SQL — I use it to **solve problems**, tell **data stories**, and drive **business decisions**."

This repo reflects **continuous improvement**. I regularly revisit queries, refine logic, and challenge myself with more complex scenarios.
